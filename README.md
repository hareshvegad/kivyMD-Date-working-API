kivyMD Date working API


Spinner Date App

This is a simple KivyMD (Material Design Components for Kivy) application that allows users to select a date using spinners and displays corresponding data from a predefined API.
Installation

Make sure you have Python and KivyMD installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following:

bash

pip install kivy kivymd

How to Run

Run the application by executing the following command:

bash

python your_script_name.py

Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script.
Usage

    Select a date using the provided spinners for day, month, and year.
    Click the "Submit" button.
    View the data corresponding to the selected date, including product details and outstanding amount.

Code Structure

    The application uses KivyMD components for the user interface.
    The data is hardcoded in the shop_api_data variable to simulate an API response.
    The Kivy language (KV) is used to define the layout of the application.
    The main logic is implemented in the SpinnerDateApp class, including handling user input, finding data for the selected date, and displaying the data.
